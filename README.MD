This small project is a style practice for me
### Image: ![Demo: ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thiZguy/weather-app/images/page-demo.gif)

## USE
 1. Clone the project
 2. Get an API key for `openweathermap.org` and replace the one on index.js
 3. open index.html with your prefered browser

## API
 it uses `openweathermap.org`'s API to fetch city weather data, so you will need an API key to execute the code
